                            <p>Our privacy policy explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by LigerTail with respect to your access and use of LigerTail's site (located at http://ligertail.com) and LigerTail's advertising services (including, but not limited to, the use of our widget).</p>
                            <p>Our privacy policy may be modified from time-to-time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on our privacy policy the date it was last updated.</p>

                            <h3>What Is Personal Information?</h3>
                            <p>"Personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number or e-mail address) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of our site and our services. Our privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

                            <h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>
                            <p>We actively collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your email address. Also: (i) if you purchase services from us, we will collect your credit card number; and (ii) if you participate in one of our programs and we owe you money, we will collect an address from you so that we can send you a check.</p>
                            <p>We automatically collect certain information when you use our site and our services, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on our site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
                            <p>We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies".</p>

                            <h3>How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?</h3>
                            <p>We use personal information collected through our site and our services for the purposes described in our privacy policy or elsewhere on our site. For example, we may use personal information we collect:</p>
                            <ul class="list">

                                <li>to monitor and analyze site usage and trends, and to personalize and improve our site and our usersâ€™ experiences on our site;</li>
                                <li>to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and otherwise facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, our site and services; and </li>
                                <li>for any other purpose for which the information was collected.</li>
                            </ul>
